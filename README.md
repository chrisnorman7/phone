# Phone

## Description

This repository houses what I hope will hopefully become the operating system for a PDA (and eventually a phone) which I hope to create.

### Aims

This OS should:

* Only use the keys available on a number pad.
* Be intuitive.
* Allow a user to perform basic day-to-day tasks without fuss or clutter.
* Have as shallow a menu structure as is possible.
* Have as many useful programs as is practical.

This OS should not:

* Be overly complicated.
* Make any attempt to divert the user's attention from what they are doing.
* Have programs added to it simply to show off programming skill.

## Hardware

This OS will eventually be run on a Raspberry Pi (although I'm currently testing on Windows). It should completely replace the default shell in text mode.
